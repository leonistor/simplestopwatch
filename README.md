# dev notes

## pnpm

The are are two key uses of npx.

- Running executables inside your downloaded dependencies, for example `npx jest`.
- The pnpm equivalent is `pnpm exec jest`.
- Running executable commands in packages you want to download transiently, for example `npx create-react-app my-app`.
- The pnpm equivalent of this is `pnpm dlx create-react-app my-app`.
